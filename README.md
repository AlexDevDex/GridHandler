# GridHandler
This tool shall take images and put them inconvienently at some specified position on the screen, thus covering the respective area and not disappear until the program is stopped. It is glorious.

The goal is to have an interactive tool for streams (on twitch, through a twitch bot and PubSub Events) so viewers can partially block a streamers screen.


Adjust the grid dimension in config (GRID_SIZE)
